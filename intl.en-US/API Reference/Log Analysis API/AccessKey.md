# AccessKey {#reference_rh5_tfy_zdb .reference}

Alibaba Cloud AccessKey is a “secure password” designed for you to access your cloud resources by using APIs \(not the console\).  You can use the AccessKey to sign API request content to pass the security authentication in Log Service.

This AccessKey is generated and used by pairing an AccessKey ID and an AccessKey Secret.  Each Alibaba Cloud user can create multiple AccessKeys.  You can also activate, deactivate, or delete the generated AccessKey as per your needs.

You can create and manage all the AccessKeys on the [Access Key Management page](https://ak-console.aliyun.com/#/accesskey)  in the Alibaba Cloud console.  Keep your AccessKey properly  because it is key to the API request security authentication of Alibaba Cloud.  We recommend that you delete the AccessKey in time and generate a new one if the AccessKey may have been leaked.
