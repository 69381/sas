# External Store overview {#concept_ecg_55q_12b .concept}

## Differences between External Store and Logstore {#section_ggv_y45_12b .section}

The Logstore stores logs and continuously receives incremental data.

The External Store stores static metadata associated with logs, and is called the external data source. Â Log Service usually performs join query between logs and other related data.

## Scenarios {#section_gcy_x45_12b .section}

-   Logstore and External Store perform join query and analysis.
-   Log Service writes the query and analysis results of Logstore to External Store.

## Supported storage types {#section_gvd_x45_12b .section}

Currently, only RDS instances in the Virtual Private Cloud \(VPC\) environment in cn-beijing, cn-qingdao, and cn-hangzhou regions can be used as External Stores. To use RDS instances in other regions as External Stores, open a ticket.

## Procedure {#section_ghs_545_12b .section}

1.  Create an External Store and specify the corresponding metadata.
2.  When querying and analyzing logs, reference the External Store name to query and write logs.
