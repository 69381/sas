    -   **Assets**: The number of assets \(ECS instances and external servers\) to be protected. By default, the purchase page displays the number of your ECS instances. You cannot specify a number that is less than the default number. 

        **Note:** If you predict that the number of your servers may increase within the validity period of your subscription, specify the predicted number of servers you will need SAS to protect as your total number of assets.

    -   **Edition**: The Enterprise Edition is selected by default. For details about the differences between the Enterprise Edition and Basic Edition, see [SAS features](../../../../intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Features.md#).
    -   Screen: Value-added service. If you select this option, SAS includes this service. Ten screens are provided for users to monitor various security statuses that use a variety of rich data visuals.
    -   **All Logs**: Value-added service. If you select this option, SAS includes this service. Ten types of security logs \(such as server logs and network logs\) can be searched for and shipped to [Alibaba Cloud Log Service](https://www.aliyun.com/product/sls) for event backtracing and security analysis.
3.   Select a **Duration** and select **Auto-renewal** if you want to enable automatic renewal. 

    **Note:** If you want to protect up to five assets, you must purchase at least a one-year subscription. If you want to protect from six to ten assets, you must purchase at least a three-month subscription. If you want to protect more than 10 assets, you must purchase at least a one-month subscription. 

    **Note:** If you enable automatic renewal, the automatic renewal cycle is aligned with the validity period of your subscription.
