-   The number of assets refers to the number of billable assets that require protection, including ECS instances and external servers. The default number of assets is the number of your ECS instances. During [Purchasing Threat Detection Service](intl.en-US/Pricing/Purchase Threat Detection Service.md#), the number of assets that you specify cannot be less than the number of your ECS instances.Â 
-   TDS also protects assets such as load balancing instances and NAT gateways. However, TDS only charges for protecting your ECS instances and external servers. All other assets are currently protected for free.
