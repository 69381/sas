Threat Detection Service \(TDS\) Enterprise Edition provides comprehensive security monitoring and diagnosis services for your assets on the cloud. You can purchase TDS Enterprise Edition by Subscription.

To purchase TDS Enterprise Edition, follow these steps:

1.  Log on to your Alibaba Cloud account, and go to the [Threat Detection Service purchase page](https://common-buy-intl.alibabacloud.com/?commodityCode=sas_intl&accounttraceid=1f5e0cf4-dfe1-4ab4-a4c9-57af70efdb4d#/buy). 
2.   Configure your required TDS. The configurations are described as follows: 
    -   **Assets**: The number of assets \(ECS instances and external servers\) to be protected. By default, the purchase page displays the number of your ECS instances. You cannot specify a number that is less than the default number. 

        **Note:** If you predict that the number of your servers may increase within the validity period of your subscription, specify the predicted number of servers you will need TDS to protect as your total number of assets.

    -   **Edition**: The Enterprise Edition is selected by default. For more information about the differences between the Enterprise Edition and Basic Edition, see [Threat Detection Service features](../../../../intl.en-US/Product Introduction/Features.md#).
    -   **All Logs**: Value-added service. If you select this option, TDS includes this service. Ten types of security logs \(such as server logs and network logs\) can be searched for event backtracing and security analysis.
3.   Select a **Duration** and select **Auto-renewal** if you want to enable automatic renewal. 

    **Note:** 

    -   If you want to protect up to five assets, you must purchase at least a one-year subscription. If you want to protect from six to ten assets, you must purchase at least a three-month subscription. If you want to protect more than 10 assets, you must purchase at least a one-month subscription. 
    -   If you enable automatic renewal, the automatic renewal cycle is aligned with the validity period of your subscription. For example, if your subscription is on a monthly basis, the automatic renewal cycle is one month. If your subscription is on a yearly basis, the automatic renewal cycle is one year.
4.   Click **Buy Now** and complete the payment.
