## Linux software vulnerability attribute descriptions {#section_dhc_1vq_32b .section}

The following table describes Linux software vulnerability attributes on the detail page.

|Attribute|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|Vulnerability|Name of the Linux software vulnerability. The vulnerability name typically starts with CVE or RHSA. Example: CVE-2018-1123 on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS \(trustly\).|
|CVSS Score|The Common Vulnerability Scoring System \(CVSS\) score that is assigned to the vulnerability by the CVSS according to the open industry standard. A CVSS score is used to rate the severity of a vulnerability to help you prioritize responses to the vulnerability.CVSS v3.0 rates the severity of vulnerabilities as follows:

-   0.0: None.
-   0.1-3.9: Low.
    -   Vulnerabilities that will cause denial of service issues.
    -   Vulnerabilities that have minor impacts.
-   4.0-6.9: Medium.
    -   Vulnerabilities that will impact users during system and user interactions.
    -   Vulnerabilities that will be exploited to perform unauthorized activities.
    -   Vulnerabilities that can be exploited after attackers have changed the local configuration or obtained important information.
-   7.0-8.9: High.
    -   Vulnerabilities that can be exploited to indirectly obtain user permissions to your server and application systems.
    -   Vulnerabilities that can be exploited to read, download, write, or delete arbitrary files.
    -   Vulnerabilities that will cause sensitive data leaks.
    -   Vulnerabilities that will cause business disruption or remote denial of service issues.
-   9.0-10.0: Critical.
    -   Vulnerabilities that can be exploited to directly obtain permissions to the operating system of your server.
    -   Vulnerabilities that can be exploited to directly obtain sensitive data and cause data leaks.
    -   Vulnerabilities that can cause unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    -   Vulnerabilities that can cause large-scale impacts.

|
|Revealed At|Time when the vulnerability was revealed.|
|CVEID|Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures \(CVE\) ID. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures \(CVE\) system provides a reference-method for publicly known information-security vulnerabilities and exposures. You can use CVE IDs, such as CVE-2018-1123, to quickly search vulnerability fix information in any CVE-compatible databases to resolve security issues.|
|Affected Assets|Servers where the vulnerability has been detected.|
|Vulnerability Fix Priority|Priority of the vulnerability rated by TDS based on multiple factors, such as the vulnerability severity, time when the vulnerability was revealed, and actual ECS environment. The vulnerability fix priorities include the following:-   **Urgent**
-   **Less urgent**
-   **Not urgent**

**Note:** For more information about how to prioritize vulnerability fixes, see [Vulnerability fix prioritization](intl.en-US/User Guide/Vulnerabilities/Vulnerability fix prioritization.md#).

|
|Details|Software directory, version, configurations, and affected items.-   **Software**: Version of the software in the operating system of the current server.
-   **Cause**: Reason why the software has this vulnerability. Typically, the main cause is that the current software version is lower than the specified software version. Another cause is that this vulnerability has already been detected in the current software version.
-   You can click **More** to view **Path**: Path of the software on the server.

|
|First/Last Detected At|The first and last time when the Linux software vulnerability was detected by TDS.|
