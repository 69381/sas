# Benefits {#concept_mqt_kvb_zdb .concept}

Threat Detection Service \(TDS\) can help to build a cloud security system that supports security events, vulnerability detection, baseline check, assert fingerprints, and log retrieval. The security events feature monitors web intrusions in real time and generates alerts when an intrusion is detected. Vulnerability detection and baseline check are used to fix system flaws and prevent attacks. Assert fingerprints and log retrieval offer data visualization for you to analyze security events and track the causes.

TDS has the following benefits:

-   **Events and log retrieval**

    TDS detects security issues in real time, provides solutions, and allows you to search and analyze logs and events.

-   **Vulnerability detection and baseline check**

    TDS automatically detects vulnerabilities and insecure configurations on assets and provides solutions to enhance system security.

-   **Risk quantification and prediction**

    TDS uses machine learning to quantify, analyze, and predict potential vulnerabilities, threats and risks.

-   **Log storage and retrieval**

    TDS creates and maintains logs for the last 180 days and allows you to search and analyze logs created in the last 30 days.Â 

-   **Visualized user interface**
