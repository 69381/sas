# Benefits of TDS {#concept_mqt_kvb_zdb .concept}

Alibaba Cloud Threat Detection Service \(TDS\) can help to build a complete cloud security system that supports security events monitoring, vulnerability detection, baseline check, asset fingerprints, and log retrieval. TDS monitors web intrusions in real time and generates security alerts when an intrusion is detected. Vulnerability detection and baseline check are used to check and fix system flaws to prevent potential attacks. Asset fingerprints update you information on server processes, your system accounts, software and listening ports. Log retrieval provides server logs and network logs to help you analyze the security trends of your servers, track the causes of security events and help you handle the security threats detected by TDS.

TDS has the following benefits:

-   **Security alerts and alert correlation**

    TDS detects security issues in real time, provides solutions, and allows you to search and analyze logs and events. Alert correlation rules automatically group the related events together and then generate a related alert. It can help you see all the related alerts on one page, and provide you with centralized management on the alerts and related events.

-   **Vulnerability detection and baseline check**

    TDS automatically detects vulnerabilities and insecure configurations on assets, and provides solutions to enhance system security.

-   **Risk quantification and prediction**

    TDS uses machine learning to quantify and analyze the threats, and predict potential risks.

-   **Visualized user interface**

    TDS provides a visualized user interface for you to view security issues at any time.

-   **Log storage and retrieval**

    TDS provides you with the last 180 days' log and allows you to search and analyze logs created in the last 30 days.

-   **Overall log analysis**

    TDS provides real-time log search and analysis, which covers all types of logs for TDS, such as starting of server process, outgoing network connection, system logon, DNS request, etc. Supports the creation of reports and alarms.
