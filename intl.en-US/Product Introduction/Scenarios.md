-   Real-time monitoring of open ports on ECS instances and security issues, including AccessKey leaks, network intrusions, DDoS attacks, and bots.
-   Tracking of intrusions, such as webshell injections, malware, and ransomware in ECS, to analyze the patterns of intrusions and locate the causes.
-   Review the related events on the same page, and make you easier to analyze and handle the events and alerts.
-   Customize the rules of alerts based on your business requirements.
-   Synchronize your real-time security overview onto a big screen in various forms.
