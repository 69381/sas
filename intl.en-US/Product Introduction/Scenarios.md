Threat Detection Service \(TDS\) can be used in the following scenarios:

-   Real-time monitoring of business security in the cloud. TDS can generate alarms for security events such as unusual logons, webshell injections, and malware.
-   Periodic vulnerability detection and baseline check for cloud services. TDS can provide vulnerability and insecure configuration detection and fixing services.
-   Query, statistics, and analysis of network logs, server logs, and user visits.
-   Real-time monitoring of open ports on ECS instances and security issues, including AccessKey leaks, network intrusions, DDoS attacks, and bots.
-   Tracking of intrusions, such as webshell injections, malware, and ransomware in ECS, to analyze the patterns of intrusions and locate the causes.
